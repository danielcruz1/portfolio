## About Me

I am a passionate developer with above average communication skills and a drive to succeed at any task given to me, or that I choose to put my mind to.
Changing career paths and choosing to get into web development has been the best decision I have ever made. Not only am I able to use my creative mind
to build amazing tools for people to use, I get to go home at the end of the day knowing that I have contributed in some way to a greater cause than myself.

I appreciate you taking the time to read a little about me, and would love an opportunity to connect with you, and to chat about what you've been working on!
